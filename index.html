                    Remember, we were never meant to do this alone. In ancestral societies, the tradition of “spoiling”
                    the new mother after childbirth is recognized as essential for the holistic well-being of both the
                    mother and her baby (so the whole society). Sadly, in today's western culture with diminishing
                    communal ties, it appears as though we have lost the skill of nurturing the Mother.

                    As your postpartum doula, I’m here to nurture and care for you so you can feel supported and
                    celebrated in the time after you birth your baby.

                    On my first visit I may prepare you a foot soak as we go through how you are feeling and outline a
                    plan for that session. We may talk about ways of bathing the baby as I prepare a nutritious snack
                    for those timeless nights when your baby has all the energy in the world! I can run some errands for
                    you, fold all your baby clothes, and also share some self-care practices like postnatal yoga, self
                    massage or breathing exercise to help you release tension and nurture yourself. All sessions are
                    designed in a personalized and unique way. I am here to support you and your family. It's a
                    blessing!
